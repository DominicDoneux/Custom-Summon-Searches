#README - Create Custom Summon Searches

---

This tool was developed by Matthew Reidsma in HTML5 and Javascript to make creating scoped searches in Summon easier. We hope you find it useful.

On February 15, 2012, Serials Solutions released their own Scoped Search creator. However, you need to be able to add Javascript to your website to use their search boxes. Some sites, including many CMSs and LMSs, strip Javascript. This tool lets you build scoped searches using good old HTML. I've updated it to work with discipline searches. 

More questions? Feel free to contact Matthew Reidsma on Twitter at @mreidsma or via email at reidsmam@gvsu.edu.
